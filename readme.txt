This Cleeng Wordpress plugin is no longer supported, as we decided to discontinue it in February 2014. Please see for reasons and alternative solutions below.

== Description ==
Despite more than 20K downloads and positive ratings, we decided to discontinue our Cleeng WordPress plugin.
Please note that all transactions made with this plugin after February 2014 won’t be processed anymore.

Pleasee see for reasons and alternative solutions below.

**Reasons:**

- Hunderds of Cleeng Publishers stopped using this plugin in favor of our flexible API (here link to http://cleeng.com/open)
- Our API is well documented, and helps you to set up memberships in just couple of minutes. If you have a bit of tech knowledge you will be able to use it right away.
- Cleeng is focusing all efforts rather on Live online events setup (link to http://cleeng.com/live), and video-on-demand than on any other type of content. We’re looking forward to strentghen our leadership in this space.

**What are the alternatives?**

1 . **Use our API** (http://cleeng.com/open), which is widely used by our Publishers.

To inspire you, we got a few examples of how Cleeng API has been integrated so far:
